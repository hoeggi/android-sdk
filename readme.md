##Warning:
You are viewing the sources of version 1.2.0RC1 . The SDK is released. Feel free to explore it.

#Last stable release

The last stable release was 1.0.0.  It is not recommended to use this as the 1.2.0RC1 is the latest. For now you can read the old [samples page](https://github.com/sensorberg-dev/android-sdk-samples) page for all neccesary information.
Please be aware, we are not currently updating the samples. We are in process of updating the sdk and will release better and updated samples in the future. 
If you have any specific questions, please reach out to us.
